========

Very early development stage. For now just scaffolding and basic zookeeper events handling.
 

Build
-----

	$ ./gradlew jar


Eclipse Development
-------------------

To import this project run:

	$ ./gradlew eclipse

That should download all dependencies and generate the appropriate .classpath and .project file.

So just go to your eclipse File -> Import... -> General/Existing Projects into Workspace, and select this directory as root
